# ðŸ–¥ Vault Warden Deployment

### <mark style="color:blue;">What's is vault warden?</mark>

Vaultwarden is the new identity of a project formerly recognized as "Bitwarden\_RS." Its primary objective is to provide users with an alternative to the official Bitwarden password manager, enabling them to host and manage their password vault in a self-hosted environment. Here's a closer look at the essential aspects of Vaultwarden:

1. **Self-Hosted Password Management**: Vaultwarden empowers both individuals and organizations to establish and maintain their instance of a password manager. This approach offers complete control over data storage and enhances privacy by allowing users to manage their password vault on their terms.
2. **Open Source**: Vaultwarden is an open-source project, meaning its source code is publicly accessible. This commitment to openness promotes transparency, encourages collaborative contributions, and ensures a higher level of security through community scrutiny.
3. **Security**: Security is at the forefront of Vaultwarden's design. The platform employs robust encryption techniques to safeguard user data. Among its security measures, it implements end-to-end encryption, a powerful safeguard that shields passwords and other sensitive information from unauthorized access.
4. **Cross-Platform Support**: Vaultwarden is committed to user convenience by providing a versatile range of tools and applications. Users can access their password vault through browser extensions, mobile apps, and desktop clients tailored for various operating systems, enabling seamless access from multiple devices.
5. **Browser Integration**: To streamline the user experience, Vaultwarden offers browser extensions. These extensions facilitate automatic password filling and allow users to efficiently manage their login credentials directly from their web browsers.
6. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Recognizing the importance of heightened security, Vaultwarden incorporates support for two-factor authentication (2FA). This additional layer of protection fortifies user accounts, making them less susceptible to unauthorized access.

In summary, Vaultwarden represents a robust and self-hosted alternative to mainstream password managers. With its commitment to open-source principles, strong security measures, and versatile accessibility options, it offers users greater control over their password management while prioritizing their privacy and data security

### <mark style="color:blue;">**How It Works:**</mark>

Vaultwarden, formerly known as Bitwarden\_RS, operates as a self-hosted password management solution, offering users a secure and controlled environment to manage their passwords and sensitive information. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it functions:

1. **Server Setup**: To initiate your Vaultwarden journey, you must establish a server where the Vaultwarden application will reside. This server can be either your dedicated hardware or a cloud-based instance, depending on your preferences and requirements.
2. **Installation**: The next step involves installing the Vaultwarden application on your chosen server. This installation process encompasses the deployment of critical software components, including the Vaultwarden server itself, a web server (commonly Nginx), and a database (typically PostgreSQL). These components work collaboratively to ensure the seamless operation of Vaultwarden.
3. **Database Storage**: Vaultwarden relies on a database to store a multitude of crucial elements, such as user accounts, encrypted passwords, and various sensitive data. Importantly, all data is subjected to robust encryption using advanced encryption algorithms. Furthermore, the decryption key remains exclusively in the hands of the user, enhancing data security.
4. **User Accounts**: Users commence their Vaultwarden experience by creating individual accounts on your self-hosted instance. Each user account is fortified by a master password, which only the respective user knows. This master password plays a pivotal role in deriving the encryption key responsible for both the encryption and decryption processes of the stored data.
5. **End-to-End Encryption**: As users begin adding passwords and other essential items to their Vaultwarden accounts, the data is encrypted right at the client's end. This encryption process relies on the user's master password and the encryption key derived from it. Once encrypted, this data is securely transmitted to the Vaultwarden server.

Vaultwarden's design places a paramount emphasis on data security, privacy, and user control. By facilitating self-hosting, robust encryption practices, and client-side data protection, Vaultwarden empowers users to confidently manage their passwords and sensitive information in a secure and personalized environment.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Steps And Procedure</mark>

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**Docker Image Selection**</mark>**:**
   * <mark style="color:orange;">Docker Image Name: vault warden</mark>
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Application Details**</mark>**:**
   * Application Name: vault warden 1
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Protocol Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `80`
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation Options**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Advanced Installation (Optional**</mark>**):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
6. <mark style="color:orange;">**Access Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation**</mark>**:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an vault warden instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
