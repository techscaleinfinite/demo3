# ðŸ–¥ Qbittorent Deployment

### <mark style="color:blue;">What's  qbittorent?</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">qBittorrent is a cross-platform BitTorrent client that is free, open-source, and allows users to download and exchange files over the BitTorrent protocol. It is a free alternative to proprietary torrent clients, with a variety of tools for organising and regulating torrent downloads. Here are some important facts regarding qBittorrent:</mark>

1. <mark style="color:orange;">**BitTorrent Client**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark> qBittorrent is designed to handle the downloading and uploading of files through the BitTorrent protocol. This protocol enables peer-to-peer file sharing, where users can exchange parts of a file with each other rather than relying on a single central server.
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Cross-Platform**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark> qBittorrent is available for various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD. This makes it accessible to a wide range of users regardless of their preferred platform.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Open Source**</mark>: qBittorrent is open-source software, which means its source code is publicly available and can be reviewed and audited by the community. This transparency helps ensure the security and integrity of the software.
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**User-Friendly Interface**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark> The user interface of qBittorrent is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. It provides easy-to-understand controls for adding, managing, and monitoring torrent downloads.
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Search and Discovery**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark> qBittorrent includes a built-in search function that allows users to search for torrents directly from within the client. This can help users discover new content to download.



### <mark style="color:blue;">**How It Works**</mark>

1. <mark style="color:orange;">**Torrent File Creation**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark> To share a file using qBittorrent, a user first creates a "torrent file." This file contains metadata about the file to be shared, such as its name, size, and a list of tracker servers. A tracker server acts as a central hub that keeps track of all the users downloading and uploading a specific torrent.
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Downloading a Torrent**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark> When a user wants to download a file, they obtain the torrent file (usually from a website or another user) and open it in qBittorrent. The torrent client uses the tracker server's information to connect to other users who are sharing the same file.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Peer Discovery**</mark>: qBittorrent connects to multiple peers (other users who are downloading or uploading the same file) and exchanges information about the parts of the file they have. Each peer becomes a source of data for others.
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Piece Downloading**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark> The file is divided into small "pieces," and each peer downloads different pieces from multiple sources simultaneously. This parallel downloading increases the overall download speed and helps distribute the load among peers.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Steps And Procedure</mark>

*   &#x20;<mark style="background-color:purple;">**This deployment utilizes the official QBittorent Docker image. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:**</mark>

    1. Begin by navigating to the "Create Apps" page and use the search bar to find the <mark style="color:orange;">linuxserver/qbittorent</mark> application.
    2. Click on the "Install" button to initiate the installation process.
    3. Fill in all the required fields with the necessary information.
    4. If you prefer, you can click on the "Advanced" option to access additional settings (this step is optional).
    5. After making your selections, press the "Install" button to proceed.
    6. Once the installation is complete, you'll be directed to the "My Apps" page, where you'll find a list of all the applications you've deployed.
    7. Copy the Hostname of the QBittorent application without the NodePort and paste it into your preferred browser's address bar.
    8. VoilÃ ! You're now able to access the QBittorent webpage and explore its content.

    By following these straightforward steps, you'll have successfully deployed the QBittorent application and gained access to its features through a seamless and user-friendly process.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Step-by-Step Guide to qbittorrent Deployment**</mark>

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**Docker Image Selection**</mark>**:**
   * <mark style="color:orange;">Docker Image Name: qbittorent</mark>
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Application Details**</mark>**:**
   * Application Name: qbittorent
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Protocol Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `8080`
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation Options**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Advanced Installation (Optional**</mark>**):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * <mark style="color:red;">Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )</mark>
       *

           ```yaml
            volumes:
                 - /path/to/appdata/config:/config
                 - /path/to/downloads:/downloads
           ```
6. <mark style="color:orange;">**Access Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation**</mark>**:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an qBittorrent instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
