# Demo Deployment

In the **Demo Deployment** section, we present two distinct deployment options: **HTTP** and **TCP**. These options provide a structured approach to deploying your applications, catering to different needs.

When you opt for HTTP deployment, you're setting up your application to communicate over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This protocol is commonly used for web-based communication. Imagine it as a route for your application to interact with web browsers, ensuring seamless communication between your app and users' devices.

On the other hand, TCP deployment operates on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). This protocol offers a reliable and ordered connection between applications. Think of it as a dedicated channel for your application's data to flow without loss or confusion.

Whether you choose HTTP or TCP deployment, you're tailoring your application's deployment to its specific communication needs. Our platform simplifies this process, ensuring your app is up and running with the right protocol, so you can focus on delivering exceptional experiences to your users
