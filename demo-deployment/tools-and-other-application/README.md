**TCP Deployments in ScaleInfinite:**

In addition to HTTP-based deployments, ScaleInfinite also offers TCP-based deployments that enable you to host a wider range of applications. These deployments include Minecraft Server and MySQL Deployment, catering to diverse application needs.

**Minecraft Server Deployment:**

1. **Description:** Minecraft Server deployment allows you to set up and host your own multiplayer Minecraft world, granting you full control over the gaming environment.
2. **Working:** After deploying, the server listens on a specific port (often 25565) for incoming connections. Players use the server's IP and port to join the game. The server manages player interactions, world data, and communication between connected players.

**MySQL Deployment:**

1. **Description:** MySQL deployment provides an instance of the popular open-source relational database system. It's widely used for storing and managing structured data.
2. **Working:** Upon deployment, the MySQL server listens on its designated port (usually 3306). Clients, such as applications, connect to the server using the specified IP and port. The server handles SQL queries, data storage, retrieval, and management.

TCP-based deployments expand the versatility of ScaleInfinite by accommodating applications that rely on TCP communication protocols. Whether you're creating gaming experiences with Minecraft Server or managing data with MySQL, these deployments enhance your options within the platform
