# PHPmyADMIN Deployment

### <mark style="color:blue;">What's  php myadmin?</mark>

phpMyAdmin is a free and open-source web-based application used for managing and administering MySQL and MariaDB databases. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface to interact with databases, making it easier for users, especially those without extensive technical knowledge, to perform various database management tasks. Here's how phpMyAdmin works:

1. **Web-Based Interface**: phpMyAdmin operates entirely through a web browser. Users access it by navigating to the phpMyAdmin URL hosted on a web server.
2. **Database Connection**: To start using phpMyAdmin, you need to establish a connection to a MySQL or MariaDB database server. You provide the server hostname or IP address, a username, and the associated password. If necessary, you can also specify the port number.
3. **User Authentication**: Once connected to the database server, phpMyAdmin typically requires users to authenticate themselves by entering a valid username and password. These credentials are verified against the database server's user accounts.
4. **Database Selection**: After successful authentication, users can select a specific database to work with. phpMyAdmin displays a list of all available databases on the server. Users can either choose an existing database or create a new one.
5. **Database Navigation**: phpMyAdmin presents the selected database's structure in a user-friendly interface. Users can see tables, views, indexes, and other database objects. Navigation is typically organized into tabs and an expandable tree structure.
6. **Table Management**: Users can manage database tables by creating new tables, modifying existing ones, or deleting tables. They can also view the structure of tables, including columns, data types, and indexes.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**How It Works:**</mark>

phpMyAdmin works as a web-based interface for managing MySQL and MariaDB databases. Here's a step-by-step overview of how it operates:

1. **Accessing the Interface**: Users access phpMyAdmin by navigating to its URL through a web browser. The phpMyAdmin interface is hosted on a web server, often the same server where the MySQL or MariaDB database is running.
2. **Login and Authentication**: Upon reaching the phpMyAdmin login page, users are required to provide valid login credentials, including a username and password. These credentials are checked against the user accounts configured in the MySQL or MariaDB database server.
3. **Selecting a Database**: After successful authentication, users can choose a specific database to work with. phpMyAdmin lists all available databases on the server. Users can either select an existing database or create a new one.
4. **Navigation and Database Structure**: Once a database is selected, phpMyAdmin provides a user-friendly interface for navigating its structure. This typically includes a sidebar with an expandable tree view of tables, views, and other database objects. Users can click on these objects to view their details.
5. **Table Management**: Users can manage database tables by creating new tables, modifying existing ones, or deleting tables. phpMyAdmin offers forms for defining table structures, including columns, data types, and indexes.
6. **Data Manipulation**: phpMyAdmin allows users to insert, update, and delete data within database tables. It offers a user-friendly form-based interface for data manipulation.
7. **SQL Query Execution**: For advanced users, phpMyAdmin provides an SQL query interface. Users can execute custom SQL queries directly against the database. This is useful for complex operations, custom reports, and data retrieval.

### <mark style="color:blue;">Steps And Procedure</mark>

*   <mark style="background-color:purple;">**This deployment utilizes the official phpmyadmin Docker image. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:**</mark>

    1. Begin by navigating to the "Create Apps" page and use the search bar to find the <mark style="color:orange;">phpmyadmin</mark> application.
    2. Click on the "Install" button to initiate the installation process.
    3. Fill in all the required fields with the necessary information.
    4. If you prefer, you can click on the "Advanced" option to access additional settings (this step is optional).
    5. After making your selections, press the "Install" button to proceed.
    6. Once the installation is complete, you'll be directed to the "My Apps" page, where you'll find a list of all the applications you've deployed.
    7. Copy the Hostname of the phpmyadmin application without the NodePort and paste it into your preferred browser's address bar.
    8. VoilÃ ! You're now able to access the phpmyadmin webpage and explore its content.

    By following these straightforward steps, you'll have successfully deployed the phpmyadmin application and gained access to its features through a seamless and user-friendly process.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Step-by-Step Guide to phpmyadmin Deployment**</mark>

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**Docker Image Selection**</mark>**:**
   * <mark style="color:orange;">Docker Image Name:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`phpmyadmin`</mark>
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Application Details**</mark>**:**
   * Application Name: `php1`
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Protocol Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `80`
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation Options**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Advanced Installation (Optional**</mark>**):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
6. <mark style="color:orange;">**Access Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation**</mark>**:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an phpmyadmin instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
