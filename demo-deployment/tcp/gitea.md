### <mark style="color:blue;">What's  Gitea?</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">Gitea emerges as a user-friendly, self-hosted comprehensive software development platform that encompasses an array of essential features, including:</mark>

1. **Git Hosting**: Gitea provides a seamless environment for hosting Git repositories. It offers a reliable foundation for version control, enabling teams to efficiently manage their source code.
2. **Code Review**: Collaborative development is made easy through built-in code review capabilities. Teams can collectively assess and refine code changes, fostering code quality and collaboration.
3. **Team Collaboration**: Gitea serves as a hub for team collaboration. It brings developers together, facilitating communication, knowledge sharing, and project management within a unified platform.
4. **Package Registry**: Developers can make use of Gitea's package registry, allowing them to store and manage software packages. This feature streamlines package distribution and access.
5. **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**: Gitea simplifies the CI/CD process, enabling automation of software builds, testing, and deployment. It supports the efficient delivery of code changes to production environments.

Gitea's roots trace back to Gogs, but it has evolved significantly through extensive code modifications. It stands as a compelling alternative to popular services like GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab, offering a self-hosted solution that grants teams greater control over their software development processes while fostering collaboration and code quality.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**How It Works**</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">In summary, Gitea simplifies and streamlines the software development lifecycle by offering a comprehensive suite of tools for version control, collaboration, and automation.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Step-by-Step Guide to gitea Deployment**</mark>

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**Docker Image Selection**</mark>**:**
   * <mark style="color:orange;">Docker Image Name:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`Gitea`</mark>
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Application Details**</mark>**:**
   * Application Name: Gitea
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Protocol Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `3000`
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation Options**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Advanced Installation (Optional**</mark>**):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * <mark style="color:red;">Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )</mark>
6. <mark style="color:orange;">**Access Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation**</mark>**:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an  GITEA instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
