#### **Troubleshooting FileZilla Connection Issues** <a href="#troubleshooting-filezilla-connection-issues" id="troubleshooting-filezilla-connection-issues"></a>

If you're experiencing connection issues with FileZilla, particularly when using Wi-Fi or mobile hotspot, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

1. 1.**Check Network Connection**:
   * Ensure that your computer is connected to the correct Wi-Fi network or mobile hotspot.
   * Check if you have a stable internet connection by visiting a website in your web browser.
2. 2.**Firewall and Antivirus**:
   * Firewalls and antivirus software can sometimes block FileZilla's connection. Check your firewall and antivirus settings to ensure they are not blocking FileZilla's access to the internet.
   * Temporarily disable your firewall or antivirus and try connecting again to see if the issue persists.
3. 3.**Check Server Details**:
   * Double-check that you've entered the correct server hostname, port number, and protocol (FTP or SFTP) in FileZilla's Site Manager.
4. 4.**Passive Mode**:
   * Try switching between active and passive mode in FileZilla's settings. Go to "Edit" > "Settings" > "Connection" > "FTP" > "Transfer Mode" and switch between "Active" and "Passive."
5. 5.**Network Restrictions**:
   * Some networks, especially public Wi-Fi networks, might have restrictions that prevent certain ports or protocols from working. Try connecting from a different network to see if the issue persists.
6. 6.**Mobile Hotspot Troubleshooting**:
   * If you're using a mobile hotspot to connect, make sure that the hotspot is enabled and has a stable connection to the internet.
   * Verify that you have sufficient mobile data or the hotspot is not restricted by your mobile carrier.
7. 7.**Restart Router/Hotspot**:
   * Sometimes, network issues can be resolved by restarting your router or mobile hotspot. Turn off the device, wait a few seconds, and then turn it back on.
8. 8.**Check FileZilla Logs**:
   * FileZilla logs can provide more information about connection issues. Go to "View" > "Message Log" to see if there are any error messages.
9. 9.**Update FileZilla**:
   * Make sure you are using the latest version of FileZilla. Outdated software can sometimes cause compatibility issues.
10. 10.**Try a Different FTP Client**:
    * If you're still experiencing issues, consider trying a different FTP client to see if the problem is specific to FileZilla.
11. 11.**Contact Support**:
    * If none of the above steps resolve the issue, consider reaching out to FileZilla's support or consulting online communities for assistance.
