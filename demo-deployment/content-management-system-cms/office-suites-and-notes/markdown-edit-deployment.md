<mark style="color:orange;">Markdown Edit is all about making your markdown editing experience as smooth as butter. So, here's a peek behind the scenes to see how it works:</mark>

1. <mark style="color:orange;">**Web Technology:**</mark> Markdown Edit is powered by the marvels of web technology. It's entirely browser-based, so there's no need to download or install anything. Simply open your web browser, and you're good to go.

This means you can instantly see how your document will appear when rendered, without having to switch to a separate preview mode.

7. <mark style="color:orange;">**Collaboration:**</mark> If you're collaborating with others, Markdown Edit usually provides sharing options. You can share your markdown document with colleagues or friends, and they can edit it simultaneously, enabling real-time collaboration.
8. <mark style="color:orange;">**Accessibility:**</mark> Markdown Edit strives to be accessible to everyone. It's designed with features that assist users with disabilities, ensuring a seamless experience for all.

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**Docker Image Selection**</mark>**:**
   * <mark style="color:orange;">Docker Image Name:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`markdown edit`</mark>
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Application Details**</mark>**:**
   * Application Name: markdown edit
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Protocol Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `80`
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation Options**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Advanced Installation (Optional**</mark>**):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * <mark style="color:red;">Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )</mark>
6. <mark style="color:orange;">**Access Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation**</mark>**:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an  markdown edit instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications.
