# Managed Kubernetes

<mark style="color:blue;">Managed Kubernetes</mark>:

* Third-party providers assume responsibility for successful K8s setup and operation, relieving you of certain or all associated tasks.
* "Managed" can encompass dedicated support, hosting with pre-configured environments, or complete hosting and operation, contingent on the vendor.

<mark style="color:purple;">Kubernetes' Built-in Features:</mark>

* Encompasses scalability, detached credential configuration, self-recovery, workload management, batch execution, and progressive application deployment.
* These features demand substantial manual configuration.

<mark style="color:purple;">Managed Solutions' Power:</mark>

* These solutions handle configuration or guide decision-making, simplifying the setup process.
* Once operational, they automate routine tasks like updates, scaling, load-balancing, and monitoring.
* When coupled with a hosting platform, managed Kubernetes services manage maintenance and configuration of your infrastructure.

Experience Kubernetes' potential with managed solutions, where excellence is curated with simplicity, automation, and attentive care.
