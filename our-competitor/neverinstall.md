# Neverinstall

Imagine a world where you can seamlessly run Linux applications in your web browser, with no tedious downloads or installations. Enter Neverinstall, the cloud-based platform that's changing the game. Here's a sneak peek into how this ingenious solution works:

**1. **<mark style="color:red;">**Pre-Optimized Application Bliss**</mark>

Neverinstall doesn't keep you waiting. It offers pre-optimized, pre-configured application images that are like speed demons. They come ready to roll with optimal settings, ensuring you can dive right into your tasks without delay.

**2. **<mark style="color:blue;">**The Magic of Audio and Video Encoding**</mark>

Your virtual display and audio servers join forces with Neverinstall's magic wand. They encode and convert audio and video into a silky-smooth stream, ready to whisk its way to your machine.

**3. **<mark style="color:yellow;">**Connect, Click, Conquer**</mark>

Your input/output devices—think mouse, keyboard, webcam, and mic—link up as virtual comrades on the remote server. This means any application can access them, putting you in the driver's seat.

So, how does Neverinstall work its magic when you're itching to launch an application? Let's break it down:

**1**<mark style="color:purple;">**. Resource Allocation**</mark><mark style="color:purple;">:</mark> Neverinstall's first trick is resource allocation. It lines up the perfect combo of compute power and memory to give your chosen application wings. And it does this in a server cluster that's oh-so-close to you, ensuring the performance is off the charts.

**2. **<mark style="color:blue;">**Ready, Set, Launch**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">:</mark> Next, it's showtime. Neverinstall downloads and fires up the pre-configured application image on its remote server. No waiting in the wings here!

**3. Lights, Camera, Action**: The encoding server steps into the spotlight, bringing the display and audio to life. It's the director of this real-time show.

**4. **<mark style="color:purple;">**Stream It Like You Mean It**</mark>: Now comes the star of the show—the encoded audio-visual stream. It's your golden ticket to interact with the application in real-time, right in your browser.

Throughout this enchanting journey, Neverinstall sprinkles in extra optimizations to make sure your application is good to go in less than 30 seconds. And once you're connected, the video stream dances to the platform's tune, adjusting resolution and bit rate based on your internet speed.

<mark style="color:green;">**A User's Dream, A CPU's Light Siesta**</mark>

From your perspective, the system resources sipped by Neverinstall are as light as a feather. Think about it as watching a live video stream—typically gobbling up a mere 30-40% of a single-core CPU and a modest 200-400 MiB of RAM. It's a recipe for efficiency that makes running Linux applications a breeze.

So, let Neverinstall be your portal to Linux application nirvana, all within the comfort of your web browser. Fast, efficient, and ready to elevate your digital journey.
