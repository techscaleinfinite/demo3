# ðŸ’§ Drupal deployment

### <mark style="color:blue;">What's Drupal?</mark>

Drupal is a dynamic and versatile open-source web content management system (CMS) that leverages the PHP scripting language to empower users in creating, managing, and customizing websites tailored to their specific requirements.

Here are the key points to note about Drupal:

Open-Source CMS: Drupal is an open-source CMS, meaning it is freely accessible to all, providing a solid foundation for website development and management without any licensing fees.

Powered by PHP: At its core, Drupal is built using PHP, a robust and flexible scripting language widely used for web development.

Modularity: Drupal boasts a modular architecture that grants users the ability to enhance and customize their websites by incorporating various modules. These modules extend the CMS's functionality to suit diverse needs.

Customization: Drupal facilitates the tailoring of a website's appearance and functionality through the utilization of themes and modules. This flexibility empowers users to craft unique and engaging digital experiences.

Community-Driven: Drupal thrives due to its vibrant and dedicated community of developers, contributors, and enthusiasts. This community actively participates in the ongoing development of Drupal, ensuring regular updates, providing support, and furnishing valuable resources to aid users in achieving their goals.

In essence, Drupal is more than just a CMS; it's a powerful and adaptable platform that enables individuals and organizations to create websites that are not only visually compelling but also rich in functionality and interactivity. Its open-source nature, coupled with its supportive community, positions Drupal as a prominent choice for web development.

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Working in Brief**</mark>

Content Creation: Drupal simplifies content creation through an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it effortless for users to generate and structure content effectively.

Modular Architecture: The strength of Drupal lies in its modular architecture, allowing users to expand and enhance their websites by integrating specific functionalities through modules. These modules are designed to address various needs, providing flexibility and adaptability.

Themes & Appearance: Drupal offers extensive options for customizing the visual aspects of your website. Themes can be applied to modify the site's appearance, ensuring it aligns with your branding and design preferences.

PHP Processing: At the core of Drupal's functionality is PHP, a dynamic scripting language. PHP processes user requests, generating web pages and content dynamically, which allows for real-time updates and interactions.

Community Support: Drupal benefits from a thriving community of developers, contributors, and users who actively engage in its ongoing development. This collaborative ecosystem ensures regular updates, provides solutions to challenges, and introduces enhancements to the platform.

Drupal's robust capabilities and open-source foundation make it a powerful choice for web content management. Its flexibility, scalability, and the support of an engaged community contribute to its reputation as a versatile solution for a wide range of web projects.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Step-by-Step Guide to Drupal Deployment**</mark>

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**Docker Image Selection**</mark>**:**
   * <mark style="color:orange;">Docker Image Name:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`drupal`</mark>
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Application Details**</mark>**:**
   * Application Name: `drupal`
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Protocol Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `80`
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation Options**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Advanced Installation (Optional**</mark>**):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
6. <mark style="color:orange;">**Access Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation**</mark>**:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an drupal instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
