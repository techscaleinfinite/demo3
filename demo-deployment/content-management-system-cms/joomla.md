### <mark style="color:blue;">**How It Works:**</mark>



Joomla operates as a content management system (CMS) with a straightforward and intuitive approach. It works by simplifying the process of creating, organizing, and presenting digital content on websites. Here's how Joomla works in a nutshell:

1. **Installation and Setup:**
   * To begin, users need to install Joomla on their web server. Most web hosting providers offer one-click installations to streamline the setup process.
   * During installation, users configure basic settings such as the website name, description, and administrator credentials.
2. **Content Creation:**
   * After installation, users can log in to the Joomla administrative panel. Here, they have access to an easy-to-use content editor, similar to a word processor.
   * Users can create and edit articles, which serve as the building blocks of their website's content. Articles can include text, images, videos, and other media.
3. **Organization with Categories:**
   * Joomla employs a category system to help users organize their content logically. Articles can be assigned to specific categories and subcategories.
   * This categorization simplifies content management, making it easier to maintain large websites with diverse content.
4. **Templates and Themes:**
   * Joomla offers a variety of templates and themes that control the visual appearance of the website. Users can choose or customize a template to match their desired design.
   * Templates are responsible for the layout, colors, fonts, and overall styling of the website.
5. **Extensions and Functionality:**
   * Joomla's extensibility is a significant strength. Users can extend their website's functionality by adding extensions like modules, plugins, and components.
   * Modules are small blocks of content that can be placed in various positions on the website.
   * Plugins enhance specific features or add new capabilities.
   * Components are more extensive and can function as standalone applications within Joomla.
6. **User Management:**
   * Joomla includes user management features, allowing administrators to create and manage user accounts with different levels of access and permissions.
   * This is useful for collaborative websites with multiple contributors or for sites that offer member-exclusive content.
7. **Menu Creation:**
   * Joomla uses a menu system to organize and navigate content. Users can create menus and menu items to structure the website's navigation.
   * Each menu item can link to articles, categories, or other types of content.
8. **Multilingual Support:**
   * Joomla supports multiple languages, enabling users to create multilingual websites. Translations can be added for articles, menus, and other content elements.
9. **Publishing and Updating:**
   * Once content is created and organized, users can publish it to make it visible on the live website. Joomla handles the presentation of content based on the chosen template.
   * Regular updates and edits can be made through the administrative panel.
10. **User-Friendly URLs and SEO:**
    * Joomla offers SEO-friendly features, including the ability to create clean and user-friendly URLs. This helps improve search engine rankings.
11. **Community and Support:**
    * Joomla benefits from an active and supportive community. Users can access forums, documentation, and extensions created by other Joomla enthusiasts.

In essence, Joomla simplifies website creation and management by providing an accessible interface, robust organizational tools, and a rich ecosystem of extensions. Users can focus on creating and delivering their content while Joomla takes care of the underlying technical aspects of web development

### <mark style="color:blue;">Steps to connect mysql and joomla</mark>

You can check out how to configure [<mark style="color:purple;">mysql.</mark>](https://docs.scaleinfinite.fr/demo-deployment/database/mysql-deployment)

Here are the general steps to configure Joomla to work with a MySQL database:

1. **Database Setup:**
   * Before you start, make sure you have MySQL installed on your server and that it's running. You should also create an empty MySQL database that Joomla will use to store its data. You can do this using the MySQL client or a graphical tool like phpMyAdmin.
2. **Joomla Installation:**
   * Download the Joomla installation package from the official Joomla website.
   * Upload the installation package to your web server's directory using FTP or a file manager provided by your hosting provider.
   * Visit your website's URL in a web browser, and the Joomla installation process will begin. Follow the on-screen instructions, which will include entering your database information.
3. **Database Configuration:**
   * During the Joomla installation, you will need to provide the following database information:
     * Database Type: Select "MySQLi" or "MySQL" as the database type, depending on your MySQL version and configuration.
     * Hostname: This is usually "localhost" if your MySQL server is on the same server as your Joomla installation. If your MySQL server is on a different server, enter the server's IP address or hostname.
     * Username: The MySQL username you created when setting up the database.
     * Password: The password associated with the MySQL username.
     * Database Name: The name of the MySQL database you created for Joomla.
4. **Table Prefix (Optional):**
   * Joomla allows you to set a table prefix for its database tables. This is a security measure that adds a prefix to the table names to help prevent conflicts with other applications sharing the same database.
5. **Site Configuration:**
   * Complete the remaining steps of the Joomla installation, which include configuring your site settings, creating an administrator account, and choosing a template.
6. **Finalize Installation:**
   * Once you've completed the installation, Joomla will create the necessary database tables and configure itself to work with the MySQL database you specified.
7. **Use Joomla:**
   * You can now use Joomla to create and manage your website's content through its user-friendly interface. Joomla will handle all database interactions behind the scenes.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Step-by-Step Guide to joomla Deployment**</mark>

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**Docker Image Selection**</mark>**:**
   * <mark style="color:orange;">Docker Image Name:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`joomla`</mark>
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Application Details**</mark>**:**
   * Application Name: `joomla`
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Protocol Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `80`
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation Options**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Advanced Installation (Optional**</mark>**):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
       *

           The following environment variables are also honored for configuring your Joomla instance:

           * `-e JOOMLA_DB_HOST=...` (defaults to the IP and port of the linked `mysql` container)
           * `-e JOOMLA_DB_USER=...` (defaults to "root")
           * `-e JOOMLA_DB_PASSWORD=...` (defaults to the value of the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable from the linked `mysql` container)
           * `-e JOOMLA_DB_NAME=...` (defaults to "joomla")

           ```yaml
            MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
           ```
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * <mark style="color:red;">Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )</mark>
6. <mark style="color:orange;">**Access Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation**</mark>**:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an joomla instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
