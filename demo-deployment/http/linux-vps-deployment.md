3. **Connect & Use:** Access your VPS remotely, just like using your computer, through a terminal or SSH connection.
4. **Controlled Environment:** Customize your VPS with the software, configurations, and tools you need.
5. **Isolation:** Your VPS is isolated from other users' activities, ensuring privacy and security.
