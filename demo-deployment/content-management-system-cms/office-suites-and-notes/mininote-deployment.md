### <mark style="color:blue;">**How It Works:**</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">**MiniNote: Where Security Meets Simplicity**</mark>

In the realm of digital sanctuaries, _MiniNote_ stands as a fortress of security with a dash of simplicity. Here's the lowdown on MiniNote's security features:

üîí **Bulletproof Encryption:**

* MiniNote wraps your notes in a cloak of encryption, ensuring that both titles and content remain as secret as the recipe for grandma's cookies. It uses AES-GCM, a formidable encryption method, courtesy of the Web Crypto API.

üîê **Password Power:**

* Remember, encryption is only as strong as your password. MiniNote lets you wield this power by using your notebook's password to derive the encryption key. Choose wisely, and your notes will be as secure as Fort Knox.

üåê **End-to-End-ish:**

* While MiniNote takes encryption seriously, it's honest about its limitations. It encrypts your notes before they travel to the server, but it's not quite "NSA-proof." The server might catch a glimpse of your password when creating a new notebook. Think of it as locking your diary with a sturdy padlock, but the locksmith knows the design.

‚öîÔ∏è **Decent Security:**

* MiniNote doesn't make grandiose claims, but it does aim for a decent level of security. It's your digital safe haven, not a spy movie prop.

In the world of note-taking apps, MiniNote strikes a balance between robust security and user-friendly simplicity. Your notes are encrypted, your thoughts are guarded, and your Markdown memoirs are in safe hands. Welcome to MiniNote, where security meets simplicity with a touch of wit.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Step-by-Step Guide to mininote Deployment**</mark>

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**Docker Image Selection**</mark>**:**
   * <mark style="color:orange;">Docker Image Name:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`mininote`</mark>
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Application Details**</mark>**:**
   * Application Name: `mininote`
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Protocol Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `3000`
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation Options**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Advanced Installation (Optional**</mark>**):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * <mark style="color:red;">Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )</mark>
       *

           ```bash
           -v mininote-data:/app/data
           ```
6. <mark style="color:orange;">**Access Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation**</mark>**:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.

By following these steps, you can effortlessly deploy an  MiniNote instance with your chosen configurations. This enables you to tailor the environment to match your application's requirements and specifications. Whether opting for the default installation or delving into advanced settings, our platform ensures a seamless deployment experience while providing you the flexibility to customize according to your needs.
