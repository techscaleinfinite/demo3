# ðŸ–¥ Media Wiki Deployment

### <mark style="color:blue;">What's media wiki?</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">MediaWiki is a versatile and open-source wiki software application developed by the Wikimedia Foundation, the same organization behind Wikipedia. It's renowned for powering Wikipedia and numerous other collaborative websites across the internet. MediaWiki is engineered to facilitate the creation and management of wikis, which are platforms where users collectively contribute and edit content. Here's a deeper look at some key features and facets of MediaWiki:</mark>

**Collaborative Editing**: At the core of MediaWiki is its ability to foster collaboration. Multiple users can seamlessly work together on content creation and editing. They have the freedom to make modifications to existing articles, introduce fresh content, and engage in discussions regarding these alterations on article talk pages.

**Version History**: Every alteration made to a page within MediaWiki is meticulously tracked and stored in a comprehensive version history. This version history is an invaluable resource that permits users to peruse previous iterations of a page, compare changes between versions, and even revert back to prior renditions when deemed necessary.

**Content Structuring**: MediaWiki excels at structuring content. Information is neatly organized into articles, which can then be effectively grouped into categories. Users are empowered to not only craft and refine articles but also to categorize them, forging a structured hierarchy through links and templates.

**User Accounts**: MediaWiki introduces user accounts, which grant users additional privileges in the editing and administrative realms. Registered users benefit from features like personal user pages, watchlists to monitor page modifications, and user talk pages that facilitate communication within the community.

**Markup Language**: MediaWiki employs a user-friendly markup language. It is designed to be intuitive and accessible, featuring straightforward syntax for text formatting, hyperlink creation, image embedding, and other formatting elements.

**Media Integration**: MediaWiki seamlessly incorporates various media types, encompassing images, audio files, and videos. Users can effortlessly upload these multimedia elements to enrich the content of articles, enhancing both visual appeal and informational depth.

MediaWiki stands as a testament to collaborative knowledge creation and dissemination. Its user-friendly interface, extensive features, and adaptability make it an ideal choice for not only Wikipedia but a myriad of collaborative projects and knowledge-sharing platforms across the digital landscape

### <mark style="color:blue;">**How It Works**</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">**Content Creation and Editing**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">: One of the fundamental features of MediaWiki is its robust content creation and editing capabilities. Users, provided they have the appropriate permissions, can author new articles or modify existing ones. Articles are typically composed using a markup language, which simplifies tasks like text formatting, hyperlink creation, and media inclusion.</mark>

**Version Control:** In the realm of version control, MediaWiki excels. It meticulously records and archives every alteration made to an article, establishing a comprehensive version history. This historical record encompasses details such as the identity of the editor, the nature of the changes, and the timestamps of modifications. This version history serves as a valuable resource, allowing users to revisit and even revert to prior iterations when necessary.

**User Contributions:** MediaWiki fosters a sense of community by offering registered users the opportunity to create personalized user pages. These pages serve as spaces where users can introduce themselves to the community and showcase their contributions to the wiki. Additionally, user talk pages provide a means of communication between users, facilitating discussions and collaborations.

**Categories and Links**: To enhance the organization of content, MediaWiki allows articles to be systematically categorized. Moreover, articles can be interlinked, creating a web of interconnected knowledge within the wiki. This interlinking simplifies navigation and promotes the discoverability of related information.

**Templates:** Templates are a powerful tool in the MediaWiki arsenal. They are reusable content blocks that can be seamlessly integrated into articles. Templates find application in a variety of contexts, including the creation of infoboxes, citation formats, and other standardized content elements.

**Searching**: The built-in search engine equips users with a powerful tool for locating articles. By inputting keywords, users can swiftly retrieve a list of pertinent articles, streamlining the process of finding relevant information.

**Media Integration:** MediaWiki facilitates the integration of multimedia elements, encompassing images, audio clips, and video files. Users can effortlessly upload and embed these media components within articles, enriching the content and making it more engaging.

**Recent Changes:** The "Recent Changes" page is an indispensable feature that offers a real-time glimpse into the wiki's activity. It presents a chronological list of the most recent edits made across the entire wiki, providing users with an efficient means of monitoring changes and staying abreast of developments.

MediaWiki stands as a testament to the collaborative spirit of online knowledge sharing. With its user-friendly interface and versatile feature set, it empowers communities to create, curate, and disseminate knowledge effectively.

<mark style="color:purple;">**Step-by-Step Guide to MEDIAWIKI Deployment**</mark>

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**Docker Image Selection**</mark>**:**
   * <mark style="color:orange;">Docker Image Name:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">`mediawiki`</mark>
2. <mark style="color:orange;">**Application Details**</mark>**:**
   * Application Name: `mediawiki`
   * Resource Allocation: Set the desired resource allocation from 0-100%.
3. <mark style="color:orange;">**Protocol Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Protocol: `HTTP`
   * Port: `80`
4. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation Options**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Default" or "Advanced" installation.
5. <mark style="color:orange;">**Advanced Installation (Optional**</mark>**):**
   * If selecting "Advanced," you can customize the environment variables and working directory:
   *   **Environment Variables:**

       Environment variables are dynamic values used by a containerized application for configuration. They are defined as key-value pairs, like `API_KEY=xyz`, and provide flexibility to adjust an app's behavior without changing its code.

       * Environment Variables: Define environment variables with keys and values (e.g., `key=value`).
   *   **Working Directory:**

       The working directory is the starting point inside a container where an app's files are located. It affects relative file paths and operations. For example, if set to `/usr/src/yourAPP`, an app will reference files from there, like `/usr/src/yourAPP/data.txt`.

       * Working Directory: Set the working directory for the application (e.g., `usr/src/yourAPP`).
       * <mark style="color:red;">Here use ( use the path after   " :"  )</mark>
       *

           ```console
           /var/www/html/sites
           ```
6. <mark style="color:orange;">**Access Configuration**</mark>**:**
   * Choose between "Public" or "Private" access to the deployed application.
7. <mark style="color:orange;">**Installation**</mark>**:**
   * Click the "Install" button to initiate the deployment process.
